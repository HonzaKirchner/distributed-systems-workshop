# Distributed systems workshop
This workshop should help you improve your knowledge of replication and sharding using a coding exercise.

## Replication

## Sharding
Your task is to implement methods in the `src/fake_redis_cluster.ts` file, which contains a class `FakeRedisCluster`.
You should implement the methods in the class so that running `npm run test:sharding` will pass with no errors.
The class holds at least 1 instance of the `FakeRedis` class. You must not change the code of `FakeRedis` class!
